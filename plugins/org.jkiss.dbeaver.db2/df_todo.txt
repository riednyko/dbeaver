- Go through all "TODO" markers

Manage explain/ddl generation table creation 
- EXPLAIN tables may be created in any schema where the user has the right to create them
  -> the schema for explain tables should be in DB2 preferences PER DATASPURCE. 
  -> By default it should be in SYSTOOLS (best place for that)
  -> the first time the user tries to do an explain, if EXPLAIN tables can not be found or are not usable 
    in standard locations (CURRENT USER then SYSTOOLS) then ask the user where to create the tables. 
    Create them and store the schema for explain tables in DATASOURCE preferences..
 
Improvements:
  - Enhance Search
    - Add Tablespaces, indexes, foreign keys, modules, routines ...
  - Propagate and use monitors everywhere
  - Optionnaly seperate some kinds of DB2Tables into distinct sub types:
    - Temporary Tables
    - Hierachies..
  - DB2DataType
    - handle super types correctly
  
Serge to check?
  - looked for icon sessions.png used by myslq and oracle, didn't find it
  - missing PK columns indicator/icon in columns lists (Unique, foreign)
  - Enhance EXPLAIN facility with a graphic view of nodes -> Later
  - CLob/Blob/XML type viewer in @Properties -> later
  
Missing Menu Actions
  - DB2Schema. Menu "Tools" with
      call sysproc.admin_drop_schema
      call sysproc.admin_copy_schema
  - DataSource
    - call sysproc.admin_cmd("backup...");
    - display current locks
    - display Server OS INFO

Missing metadata:
- DB2TablePartition
  - keys in DATAPARTITIONEXPRESSION 
- DB2TableColum (DB2 v10.1+)
  - Masks + Row Permissions (SYSCAT.CONTROLS)
- DB2Routines
  - methods
  - dependencies
  - options
- Federated Function Mappings (routinesfederated, funcmapping)
- Federated Remote indexes (indexoptions)

Missing relationships (All nice to have):
   - Tables     -> referenced by triggers (that could be in a different schema...)
   - Tables     -> referenced by aliases (that could be in a different schema...)
   - Tables     -> referenced by indexes  (that could be in a different schema...)
   - Sequences  -> referenced by aliases (that could be in a different schema...)
