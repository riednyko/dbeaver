
TODO:
- Go through all "TODO" markers and flush remaining unused classes

Problems :
- (minor importance) investigate while DDL generation does not work for some kind of "regular tables"
- when a drop action fail, the structure need to be refresh. where to do that?
- Manage explain/ddl generation table creation correctly
  - EXPLAIN tables can be cecreated in any schema where the user has the right
  Q: How to handle this?
 
Missing Functions:
- Editors  / Object creators
- Remove "rename" and "edit" action on schema

Display: 
 - display timestamps with 6 microseconds
 - missing PK columns indicator/icon in lits of columns (Unique, foreign)
 

Missing objects
  - Table check constraints
  - Column check constraints
  - Nicknames
  - Synonyms
  - Servers
  - DB2User
  - DB2Groups
  - ..


Missing relationships:
   - Tables -> Tablespaces (x3) links
   - Tablespace->Bufferpool link on BPName
   - Tables -> referenced by triggers
   
   
Missing Dependencies for 
  - DB2Views
  - DB2Package
  - Procedure/Functions


Missing Actions
  db2 reorg
  db2 runstats
  db2 backup
  drop
  rename
  set integrity
  call sysproc.admin_drop_schema
  call sysproc.admin_copy_schema
  ...

Improvements:
  - Enhance connection view with DB2 trace settings - > Serge
  - Enhance EXPLAIN facility: add a graphic view?
  - Enhance SQL Content assist
  - Transform Trigger dependencies into "real objects" 
  - Propgate and use monitors everywhere
  - Lazy loading

  - Split DB2Tables into distinct sub types:
    - Regular
    - MQT
    - Temporary Tables
    - Alias
    - Hierachies..

    
Data available at the database level  
  - Applications/Sessions
  - DB parameters
  - DBM parameters
