
TODO:
- Go through all "TODO" markers and flush remaining unused classes

Problems :
- (minor importance) investigate while DDL generation does not work for some kind of "regular tables"
- when the user cancel a drop action after viewing the drop command, the structure need to be refreshed. how to do that?

Manage explain/ddl generation table creation 
- EXPLAIN tables can be created in any schema where the user has the right
- If EXPLAIN tables notfound in standard location (CURRENT USER + SYSTOOLS) then ask teh user where to create the tables
 
Missing Functions:
- Editors  / Object creators / Managers
- Remove "edit" action on schema

Display: 
 - display timestamps with 6 microseconds

Add the following Actions Meenu
  - DB2Schema. Menu "Tools" with
      call sysproc.admin_drop_schema
      call sysproc.admin_copy_schema
  - DB2Tables. Menu "Tools" with 
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("reorg table xx");
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("runstats table xx");
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("load table xx");
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("export table xx");
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("import table xx");
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("describe table xx");
      call sysproc.ADMIN_MOVE_TABLE();
     set integrity
  - DataSource
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("backup...");

Add a "System" menu at the datasource level with
- current locks
- Server OS INFO

Add a "Federation" menu at the datasource level with (<1% of users use federation=oracle dblinks)
- Servers
- Wrapeprs
- Federated Users
- Nicknames (or maybe under the "schema" section)?

Missing relationships:
   - Tablespace->Bufferpool link on BPName
   - Tables -> referenced by triggers
   - Tables -> referenced by aliases
   - Sequencess -> referenced by aliases
   
Missing Dependencies for 
  - DB2Views
  - DB2Package
  - Procedure/Functions

Improvements:
  - Enhance connection view with DB2 trace settings - > Serge
  - Enhance EXPLAIN facility: add a graphic view?
  - Enhance SQL Content assist
  - Transform Trigger dependencies into "real objects" 
  - Propgate and use monitors everywhere
  - Lazy loading
  - missing PK columns indicator/icon in lits of columns (Unique, foreign)
  - Split DB2Tables into distinct sub types:
    - Regular
    - MQT
    - Temporary Tables
    - Hierachies..
