- Go through all "TODO" markers and flush remaining unused classes
- finish DB2SequenceManager (alter) + solve enum display/setter problem

Problems :
- (minor importance) investigate while DDL generation does not work for some kind of "regular tables"
- when the user tries to delete a schema but the SQL drop fail (ie because it is linked to an existing object)
  or 
  the user cancels a drop action after viewing the drop command, 
  then the schema disappear from the list
  -> the schema must dissapear from the schema list ONLY if the drop succedeed..

Manage explain/ddl generation table creation 
- EXPLAIN tables may be created in any schema where the user has the right to create them
  -> the schema for explain tables should be in DB2 preferences. By default it is SYSTOOLS (best place for that)
  -> the first time the user tries to do an explain, if EXPLAIN tables can not be found or not usable 
    in standard locations (CURRENT USER then SYSTOOLS) then ask the user where to create the tables. 
    Create them and store the schema for explain tables in preferences..
 
Improvements:
  - by default, the DB2 timestamps display format should be with 6 microseconds : 2013-09-12-18.05.00.000000
  - Enhance SQL Content assist + Search
    - Add Tablespaces, indexes, columns, foreign keys...
  - Propagate and use monitors everywhere
  - Lazy loading
  - Split DB2Tables into distinct sub types:
    - Regular
    - MQT
    - Temporary Tables
    - Hierachies..
  
Serge to check?
  - check DB2TopSQL.getText() on how to display CLobs
  - in "session/aplication" view, we don't have any SQL text to display. Could we hide the corresponding  panel section?
  - looked for icon sessions.png used by myslq and orcle, didn't find it
  - missing PK columns indicator/icon in columns lists (Unique, foreign)
  - Enhance connection view with DB2 trace settings 
  - Enhance EXPLAIN facility with a graphic view of nodes -> Later
  
Missing Menu Actions
  - Almost everywhere
    - Editors  / Object creators / Managers
  - DB2Schema. Menu "Tools" with
      call sysproc.admin_drop_schema
      call sysproc.admin_copy_schema
      Remove "edit" action on schema
  - DB2Tables. Menu "Tools" with 
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("reorg table xx");
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("runstats table xx");
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("load table xx");
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("export table xx");
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("import table xx");
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("describe table xx");
      call sysproc.ADMIN_MOVE_TABLE();
     set integrity
  - DataSource
    - call sysproc.admin_cmd("backup...");
    - current locks
    - Server OS INFO

Missing relationships (All nice to have):
   - Tablespace -> Bufferpool link on BPName (On id)
   - Tables     -> referenced by triggers (that could be in a different schema...)
   - Tables     -> referenced by aliases (that could be in a different schema...)
   - Tables     -> referenced by indexes  (that could be in a different schema...)
   - Sequences  -> referenced by aliases (that could be in a different schema...)
   
Add a "Federation" menu at the datasource level with (<1% of users use federation=oracle dblinks)
- Servers
- Wrapeprs
- Federated Users
- Nicknames (or maybe under the "schema" section)?
