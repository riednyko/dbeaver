
TODO:
- Go through all "TODO" markers and flush remaining unused classes

Problems :
- (minor importance) investigate while DDL generation does not work for some kind of "regular tables"
- when a drop action fail, the structure need to be refresh. where to do that?

Manage explain/ddl generation table creation correctly
- EXPLAIN tables can be created in any schema where the user has the right
- If EXPLAIN tables notofund in standard location (CURRENT USER + SUSTOOLS) then ask teh user where to create the tables

 
Missing Functions:
- Editors  / Object creators / Managers
- Remove "edit" action on schema


Display: 
 - display timestamps with 6 microseconds


Add the following Actions Meenu
  - DB2Schema. Menu "Tools" with
      call sysproc.admin_drop_schema
      call sysproc.admin_copy_schema
  -DB2Tables. Menu "Tools" with 
      call sysproc.asmin_cmd("reorg table xx");
      call sysproc.asmin_cmd("runstats table xx");
      set integrity
      
  db2 backup


Add a "System" menu at the datasource level with
- Current  Applicationa
- TOP SQL Statements
- current locks
- database configuration
- instance configuration
- Server OS INFO


Add a "Federation" menu at the datasource level with
- Servers
- Wrapeprs
- Federated Users
- Nicknames (or maybe under the "schema" section)?


Missing relationships:
   - Tables -> Tablespaces (x3) links
   - Tablespace->Bufferpool link on BPName
   - Tables -> referenced by triggers
   - Tables -> referenced by aliases
   - Sequencess -> referenced by aliases
   
   
Missing Dependencies for 
  - DB2Views
  - DB2Package
  - Procedure/Functions

Improvements:
  - Enhance connection view with DB2 trace settings - > Serge
  - Enhance EXPLAIN facility: add a graphic view?
  - Enhance SQL Content assist
  - Transform Trigger dependencies into "real objects" 
  - Propgate and use monitors everywhere
  - Lazy loading
  - missing PK columns indicator/icon in lits of columns (Unique, foreign)
  

  - Split DB2Tables into distinct sub types:
    - Regular
    - MQT
    - Temporary Tables
    - Hierachies..
