
TODO:
- Go through all "TODO" markers

Improvements:
  - Enhance Search
    - Add Tablespaces, indexes, foreign keys, modules, routines ...
  - Propagate and use monitors everywhere
  - Optionnaly seperate some kinds of DB2Tables into distinct sub types:
    - Temporary Tables
    - Hierachies..
  - DB2DataType
    - handle super types correctly
  
Serge to check?
  - looked for icon sessions.png used by myslq and oracle, didn't find it
  - missing PK columns indicator/icon in columns lists (Unique, foreign)
  - Enhance EXPLAIN facility with a graphic view of nodes -> Later
  - CLob/Blob/XML type viewer in @Properties -> later
  
Missing Menu Actions
  - DB2Schema. Menu "Tools" with
      call sysproc.admin_drop_schema
      call sysproc.admin_copy_schema
  - DataSource
    - call sysproc.admin_cmd("backup...");
    - display current locks
    - display Server OS INFO

Missing metadata:
- DB2TablePartition
  - keys in DATAPARTITIONEXPRESSION 
- DB2TableColum (DB2 v10.1+)
  - Masks + Row Permissions (SYSCAT.CONTROLS)
- DB2Routines
  - methods
  - dependencies
  - options
- Federated Function Mappings (routinesfederated, funcmapping)
- Federated Remote indexes (indexoptions)

Missing relationships (All nice to have):
   - Tables     -> referenced by triggers (that could be in a different schema...)
   - Tables     -> referenced by aliases (that could be in a different schema...)
   - Tables     -> referenced by indexes  (that could be in a different schema...)
   - Sequences  -> referenced by aliases (that could be in a different schema...)
