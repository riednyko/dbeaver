
TODO:
- Go through all "TODO" markers and flush remaining unused classes

Problems :
- (minor importance) investigate while DDL generation does not work for some kind of "regular tables"
- when the user cancel a drop action after viewing the drop command, the structure need to be refreshed. how to do that?

Manage explain/ddl generation table creation 
- EXPLAIN tables may be created in any schema where the user has the right to create them
- If EXPLAIN tables not found in standard locations (CURRENT USER then SYSTOOLS) then ask teh user where to create the tables
 
Missing relationships:
   - Tablespace->Bufferpool link on BPName
   - Tables -> referenced by triggers
   - Tables -> referenced by aliases
   - Sequencess -> referenced by aliases
   
Improvements:
  - by default, the DB2 timestamps display format must be with 6 microseconds : 2013-09-12-18.05.00.000000
  - Enhance SQL Content assist + Search
    - Add Tablespaces, indexes, columns, foreign keys...
  - Propgate and use monitors everywhere
  - Lazy loading
  
  - Serge?
    - missing PK columns indicator/icon in  columns lists (Unique, foreign)
    - Enhance connection view with DB2 trace settings -> Serge?
    - Enhance EXPLAIN facility: add a graphic view? -> Serge?
  
  - Split DB2Tables into distinct sub types:
    - Regular
    - MQT
    - Temporary Tables
    - Hierachies..

Missing Menu Actions
  - Almost everywhere
    - Editors  / Object creators / Managers
  - DB2Schema. Menu "Tools" with
      call sysproc.admin_drop_schema
      call sysproc.admin_copy_schema
      Remove "edit" action on schema
  - DB2Tables. Menu "Tools" with 
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("reorg table xx");
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("runstats table xx");
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("load table xx");
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("export table xx");
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("import table xx");
      call sysproc.admin_cmd("describe table xx");
      call sysproc.ADMIN_MOVE_TABLE();
     set integrity
  - DataSource
    - call sysproc.admin_cmd("backup...");
    - current locks
    - Server OS INFO

Add a "Federation" menu at the datasource level with (<1% of users use federation=oracle dblinks)
- Servers
- Wrapeprs
- Federated Users
- Nicknames (or maybe under the "schema" section)?
