        <h1>Data Filtering & Ordering</h1>
        <p>You may specify criteria for specific columns. Criteria is not just a value but part of an SQL WHERE clause.
            For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>= 'Some Value'</code></li>
            <li><code>LIKE '%Value%'</code></li>
            <li><code>BETWEEN 1 AND 1000</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>To order by a column click on second column cell. The arrow shows order direction (ascending or descending) and the number indicates the order number of this column.</p>
