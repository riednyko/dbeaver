DBeaver has configurations for all these drivers.
If you don't have internet access when using DBeaver then you may just extract this archive
in the same directory where DBeaver was installed.

Default DBeaver installation folder in Windows is standard "Program Files" folder,
so typically it will be "C:\Program Files\DBeaver\" for Windows XP 32-bit.
Extract this archive in this folder so drivers will be located in
"C:\Program Files\DBeaver\drivers\" folder.

After that DBeaver will automatically locate driver's files whenever you create a new connection.
