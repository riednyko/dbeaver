<h1>Frequently Asked Questions about DBeaver</h1>
<p>This is draft version of "Frequently Asked Questions", more information will be added soon</p>

<h2>General</h2>
<h3>Why "DBeaver"</h3>
<p>DBeaver named in contrast to SQuirreL, popular java-based database client.
It's something like "database beaver versus SQL squirrel".
DBeaver is pronounced as <code>dee-beaver</code>.
<!--We hope that beaver will be much stronger, faster and smarter than squirrel :)-->
</p>

<h3>What is "JKISS"</h3>
<p>It's our company name. It's an acronym ("Just Keep It Straight and Simple" or "Just Keep It Simple, Stupid").
JKISS is pronounced as <code>jey-kiss</code>.
</p>

<h3>Who makes it and for what reason</h3>
<p>Check <a href="/about/team">Team</a> page to see who we are.</p>
<p>For now there is no any certain goal of this project. We just want to make a good (better than ony other) universal tool to work with databases.</p>
<p>This is a completely non-commercial project, nobody pays us for the job, there are no donations or any other kind of funding. This project is powered by our pleasure for 100%.</p>
<p>So far.</p>

<h3>May I access DBeaver source code?</h3>
<p>Not yet. At the moment DBeaver is completely freeware but it is not opensource. It may become so in the future.
Actually we have plans to open sources this year but first we want to make really fully functional and stable version.</p>

<h2>Installing and running</h2>
<h3>DBeaver doesn't start</h3>
<p>A1: You have old Java or not Java VM installed. DBeaver require Java 1.6.
    You may get newest Java from <a href="http://java.com">http://java.com</a> or you may use automatic installer (Windows version) which will check and install Java 1.6 on demand.
    If you have different versions of JVM on your computer then you may specify particular one in command line (check readme file for command line arguments description).</p>

<p>A2: You use wrong DBeaver version (e.g. 64bit on 32bit OS)</p>

<p>A3: You have extracted archive with newer version of DBeaver in the folder where older version has been installed.
    Sometimes it may cause file versions' conflicts. You may fix it by removing all contents of folder "configuration" excepting the file "config.ini".</p>

<h3>Where DBeaver stores it's configuration and how can I change it</h3>
<p>By default DBeaver stores all its data in user's home ".dbeaver" folder.
    E.g. <code>"C:\Users\&lt;UserName&gt;\.dbeaver"</code> or <code>"/home/&lt;UserName&gt;/.dbeaver"</code>.
    This folder won't be deleted upon uninstall or reinstall so new version of DBeaver will use existing configuration/data.
    You may freely replace this folder - DBeaver will just start with default settings.</p>
<p>You may change default configuration location using command line parameter "-data".
    Check <code>readme.txt</code> file for command line parameters description.</p>

<h3>Database driver not found</h3>
<p>If you use custom driver then check driver's properties in driver manager. Make sure that all driver's libraries (jars)
    are valid and that driver's class could be found by DBeaver (use "Find Class" button). If DBeaver can't locate any driver class in specified libraries
    then likely you have invalid or broken libraries.</p>
