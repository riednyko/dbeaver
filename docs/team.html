<h1>DBeaver Team</h1>

At the moment there is not much to say.
Author, architect, main developer, UI designer, tester, sysadmin, webmaster, etc - Serge Rieder. It's me.
Contact me by email (<a href="mailto:serge@jkiss.org">serge@jkiss.org</a>) or by skype (<a href="skype:serge.rider">serge.rider</a>).

Also there are people who helps me in different ways. These are my colleagues and friends:
- Eugene Fradkin - alpha-testing, some ideas in UI and a lot of discussions about software development in general during business lunches :)
- Andrey Sukhanov - testing on Unix platforms and assistance in web hosting.<br/>

And, of course, there are people who send bug reports and feature requests - by email or in the forum. Thank you, we really appreciate this.

So, the team is extremely small for now. Obviously team size will increase as the project will grow.
If you want to join or if you have any suggestions for the project - please contact me.

Thank you for using DBeaver,
<i>Serge</i>

PS: English is not my native language so I beg your pardon for grammatical mistakes all around the site. I hope we'll find English copywriter soon ;)
