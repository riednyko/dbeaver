DBeaver build
=================================
=================================

We use Eclipse pde build to compile and package DBeaver product.
Certain installers (Windows, Debian, etc) are created by additional tools.

Prerequisites
=================================

Java SDK 1.6 or later (should be default JDK with binaries in PATH)
Apache Ant 1.7 or later (should be in PATH)
Eclipse 3.7 (RCP developers package, with GEF plugins)

For Windows installer NSIS installation is required.

Prepare build
=================================

Checkout entire DBeaver module from version control system.
I'll mention root directory of DBeaver sources as $ROOT%.
Go to "product" folder. Copy "local.sample" file into "local.properties".
Edit local.properties file:

buildDirectory=%ROOT%/product/build
	Directory where all temporary build files will be placed
baseLocation=%ECLIPSE_HOME_FOLDER%
	Eclipse installation directory
equinoxLauncherPluginVersion=1.2.0.v20110502 
	Version of equinox launcher. 
	Find org.eclipse.equinox.launcher_*.jar file in your Eclipse "plugins" folder end enter version number here.
pdeBuildPluginVersion=3.7.0.v20110512-1320
	PDE build version.
	Find org.eclipse.pde.build_3* folder in your Eclipse "plugins" folder and enter version here.
configs=Build configurations list
	Leave just those configurations you want to build.
	For example: "win32, win32, x86 & win32,win32,x86_64"

nsisDirectory=%NSIS_HOME_GOLDER%
	NSIS installation directory (required only for windows installers)
releaseFilesDirectory=
	Some folder where to place releases. Doesn't required for regular developers
babelLocation=
	Needed only if you build product with multiple localizations
locales=
	Needed only if you build product with multiple localizations

Build
=================================

Execute "ant all" command (when you are in the "product" folder).
Build takes a few minutes. After it successfully completes you will have set of zip archives in "build" folder and
set of installers in "dist" folder.

Note that target "all" builds all available installers so, if you don't have NSIS installed on your computer
windows installer will fail. Also some unix installers will fail on Windows computer.
But you may build only required installers.
Execute "antt build" command to create plain archives.
Then you may execute any of "dist-*" targets, like "dist-win", "dist-deb", etc. Examine "build.xml" file to
see all available targets.
