The '''DBeaver''' is a universal database administration tool and SQL client. Generally it uses [[JDBC]] drivers to allow users to work with databases. It provides an SQL editor that offers code completion and syntax highlighting for standard [[SQL]] and database metadata browser which allows to view database structure and settings. Also it has a set of tools and plugins which allows to view/edit ER diagrams, perform export and import of tables and databases, etc. DBeaver has a plugin architecture that allows to create custom plugins for certain databases to provide non-standard database features (like tablespaces, stored procedures, security management, etc). 
As DBeaver is written entirely in [[Java platform|Java]] with [[Standard Widget Toolkit|SWT]] UI components, it has to run on any platform that has a [[JVM]].

DBeaver is freeware and open-source. It is released under terms of [[GPL]] license.
