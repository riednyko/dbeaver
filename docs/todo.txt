Major:

1. Disconnect detection (by error code)
2. Multiple result sets support (MS SQL)
3. Dialect-dependent SQL generator
4. Folder for connections
5. Client-side filters (maybe a bad idea)
6. Outline for data editor (RSV) - columns' filters, search, hide/show
7. Check on MacOS
8. Query manager fixes. + keep only primitive props + persistence
9. Connection per editor support. Host ExecutionContext in editors instead of DataSource.
10. Async autocomplete


Minor:

rename mysql (generic?) table,column
comment mysql table, column


Connection "dirty" flag handle
Structs in record mode

Office formats support (xls, doc) for export/import. Possibly office extension.

Search in multiple data sources
Search results reflect on disconnect

Generic driver config for additional metadata reading (stored procedures, ete).
Columns ordering/search (record mode)
DB toolbar visibility config in Eclipse mode
