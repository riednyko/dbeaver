Major:

1. Dialect-dependent SQL generator
2. Client-side filters (maybe a bad idea)
3. Reopen table (entity) editors after restart
4. Disconnect detection (by error code)
5. Outline for data editor (RSV) - columns' filters, search, hide/show
6. Async autocomplete
7. Check on MacOS
8. Query manager fixes. + keep only primitive props + persistence
9. Connection per editor support. Host ExecutionContext in editors instead of DataSource.

Minor:

rename mysql (generic?) table,column
comment mysql table, column


Connection "dirty" flag handle
Structs in record mode

Office formats support (xls, doc) for export/import. Possibly office extension.

Search in multiple data sources
Search results reflect on disconnect

Generic driver config for additional metadata reading (stored procedures, ete).
Columns ordering/search (record mode)
DB toolbar visibility config in Eclipse mode
