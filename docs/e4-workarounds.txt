
1. Disable Quick Access widget from main toolbar

There is no programmatic way to do it.
The only known solution is to declare application CSS:
declare property applicationCSS in product definition and set it to something like platform:/plugin/org.jkiss.dbeaver.core.application/css/default.css
It is not a perfect solution because this CSS style must contain entire UI theme definition. We can't use standard CSS themes
and we can't declare our own because it is platform dependent.

So, perfect solution (for now, latest Eclipse version is 4.2.2) is to modify base platform CSS
(it is located in org.eclipse.platform plugin, file css/e4_basestyle.css).

Next declation has to be added in the end of this file:

#SearchField {
     visibility: hidden;
}
